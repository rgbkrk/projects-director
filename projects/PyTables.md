##Description##

PyTables is a package for managing hierarchical datasets designed to efficiently cope with extremely large amounts of data.

It is built on top of the HDF5 library, the Python language and the NumPy package. It features an object-oriented interface that, combined with C extensions for the performance-critical parts of the code, makes it a fast yet extremely easy-to-use tool for interactively storing and retrieving very large amounts of data.

[FAQ — Citing](http://www.pytables.org/FAQ.html#how-can-i-cite-pytables)



The recommended way to cite PyTables in a paper or a presentation is as following:



Author: Francesc Alted, Ivan Vilata and others

Title: PyTables: Hierarchical Datasets in Python

Year: 2002 -

URL: http://www.pytables.org

Here’s an example of a BibTeX entry:


##History##

"Since August 2015, PyTables is a NumFOCUS project, which means that your donations are fiscally sponsored under the NumFOCUS umbrella. Please consider donating to NumFOCUS."



"Because, back in August 2002, one of its authors (Francesc Alted \[10\]) had a need to save lots of hierarchical data in an efficient way for later post-processing it. After trying out several approaches, he found that they presented distinct inconveniences. For example, working with file sizes larger than, say, 100 MB, was rather painful with ZODB (it took lots of memory with the version available by that time).
