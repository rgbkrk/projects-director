## Governance

From the [Software Carpentry Foundation](https://software-carpentry.org/scf/) page:

The Software Carpentry Foundation oversees all aspects of Software Carpentry's operations. It has four components:

The Membership includes every instructor who has taught at least twice in the past two calendar years, anyone who has done 30 days or more work for the SCF in the past calendar year, and anyone who has, in the opinion of the Steering Committee, made a significant contribution in the past year. Members elect the Steering Committee, and may also seek election to it.

The Steering Committee makes all significant strategic and financial decisions for the Foundation. Its members are elected annually from and by the membership.

The Advisory Council includes representatives of organizations that support the Software Carpentry Foundation's mission. The Steering Committee must consult with it when making significant strategic, contractual, or financial decisions. Partner organizations in Silver, Gold or Platinum tiers may appoint a representative, and the Steering Committee may co-opt additional persons to the Advisory Council from the wider community.

The Executive Director is appointed by, and answers to, the Steering Committee. He or she is a paid employee of the Foundation, and is responsible for overseeing its day-to-day operations.
